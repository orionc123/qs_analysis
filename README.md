# Quicksort Analysis
The Quicksort algorithm is a rather interesting one. Its worst-case time complexity is
O(n^2), and its best-case time complexity is O(nlgn), but on average Quicksort runs in Î˜(nlgn). I used
this program to compare the time complexity of Quicksort, Mergesort, and Selectionsort for random inputs of varying sizes.
